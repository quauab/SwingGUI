# Swing GUI
A template for a JFrame and JPanel. The CustomFrame class extends JFrame. It contains code to remember it's last location, at run-time it looks for
an icon for the interface named appicon.gif but defaults to medium.gif if appicon.gif is not found.

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Downloand project's zip</li>
  <li>Compile project</li>
  <li>Generate jar library</li>
  <li>Add jar as external library</li>
</ol>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/quauab/SerialManager">SerialManager</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/quauab/PathValidator">PathValidator</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
Pure laziness. I was fed up with writing the interface code from scratch, with the other features I wanted.
